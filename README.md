# Mathematics-Notes
Notes in LaTeX for learning Mathematics, both self-taught and from school.

My plan is that Finish Mathematical Analysis this school year, using both Zorich's *Mathematical Analysis* and Multivariable Calculus course provided by Ohsx.

Next year I'll learn Abstract Algebra and Topology beside my regular school maths class (*i.e.* IB Maths HL).
